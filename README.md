# Review analyzer for hotels. 
## Purpose:
This project seeks to create a service to monitor and report "bad" reviews that need immediate attention. 

### Background:
A key problem faced by managers of multiple hotel properties is to manage real customer reviews and ratings that are being posted on numerous web-site. Reviews can be aggregated, but we need to go beyond to add real value. This project is building 

1. A review aggregation and parsing service 
2. A multi-class text classification engine that sorts the "really really bad" reviews that need immediate (and often most) attention because they really stand out and damage the brand 
3. Future: categorize good and bad reviews to category to know "what works / does not work" .
